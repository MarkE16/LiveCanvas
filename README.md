## Setup

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
> - Install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/), as this project uses this package manager instead of the usual `npm` provided by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

To run the application locally, start by cloning the repo and navigating into the directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarkE16/LiveCanvas

... cloning ...

$ cd LiveCanvas # after clone is complete.
```

Next, install all the required packages (see [prerequisites](https://github.com/MarkE16/LiveCanvas#prerequisites) if you don't have `pnpm` installed).

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

Almost done! All that's left now is to run the project. To start up the project:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

You're all set!

## Contribution

- ‚≠ê We're **actively seeking skilled web developers** to contribute on maintaining this project. If you're interested, reach out to @MarkE16, we'd love to work with you!

## Why should you contribute?
- üí°  **Experience** - Unlike basic e-commerce sites, this project challenges you to write logic for a drawing editor.
- üòé **Learning** - While React.js is widely used, building an editor allows you to deepen your knowledge and face new challenges. It‚Äôs also a great opportunity to learn how to write tests if you haven‚Äôt already.
- ‚ú® **Visibility** - Contributing to open-source is both enjoyable and valuable, enhancing your experience and credibility in collaborative projects.

If you are interested in taking the time to propose code implementation, feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request.
