## Setup

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
> - Install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/), as this project uses this package manager instead of the usual `npm` provided by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

To run the application locally, start by cloning the repo and navigating into the directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarkE16/LiveCanvas

... cloning ...

$ cd LiveCanvas # after clone is complete.
```

Next, install all the required packages (see [prerequisites](https://github.com/MarkE16/LiveCanvas#prerequisites) if you don't have `pnpm` installed).

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

Almost done! All that's left now is to run the project. To start up the project:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

You're all set!

## Why should you contribute?
💡 Experience - This project is different from a majority of other projects such as basic e-commerce websites as it puts your skills to the test to write logic to facilitate a drawing editor.
😎 Learning - Although React.js is common, you get to learn how to extend your knowledge when using React for solving problems that may arise in building something like an editor. Additionally, you can learn to write tests if you've never done that sort of thing before.
✨ Visibility - Contributing to open-source is fun and can look good for your experience when contributing to other people.


In case you haven't already noticed, this project is **open-source**, meaning anyone can contribute to help build this project from the ground up. If you are interested in 
taking the time to propose code implementation, feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request.
