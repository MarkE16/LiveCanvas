# IdeaDrawn | LiveCanvas

An open-source web based canvas editor.

> Please note that this project is in the beginning of its development stages, so there is not an expected stable release of the software at the moment.

## Setup

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
> - Install [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/), as this project uses this package manager instead of the usual `npm` provided by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

To run the application locally, start by cloning the repo and navigating into the directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MarkE16/LiveCanvas

... cloning ...

$ cd LiveCanvas # after clone is complete.
```

Next, install all the required packages (see [prerequisites](https://github.com/MarkE16/LiveCanvas#prerequisites) if you don't have `pnpm` installed).

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

Almost done! All that's left now is to run the project. To start up the project:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

You're all set!
